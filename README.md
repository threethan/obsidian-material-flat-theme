![Material Flat Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threethan/obsidian-material-flat-theme/main/screenshot-hd.png)

**Take Obsidian on the go, your way.**
A theme that looks and works great - On all your devices.

## Features
### Customizable Color Palette
Just about every color in Material Flat is derived from your accent color, and will adapt to both light and dark themes with ease!

No need for preset colors or complex menus, simply set your color of choice in `Obsidian > Settings > Appearance` and enjoy.

### Floating Action Button

Skip the thumb-stretching. Access a button of your choice on the bottom-right. Install the [Commander](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-commander) plugin to customise the FAB command to your liking. 

### Better Translucency
Obsidian's default translucency does not play well with themes, and causes servere lag on windows. Material Flat allows for proper translucency support through the window manager - including support for native-style wallpaper tinting on mac and windows.
