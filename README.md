### Tonal colour palettes & Adaptive type scale

Obsidian You is based on Google's [Colour System](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/the-color-system/) and [Typography](https://m3.material.io/styles/typography/overview). Carefully generated colour palettes make Obsidian beautiful, consistent and accessible. Light or dark mode alike. The M3 type scale makes sure all your text is styled consistently.

### Floating Action Button

Skip the thumb-stretching. You can even customise the FAB command to your liking. Install the [Customizable Page Header Buttons](https://github.com/kometenstaub/customizable-page-header-buttons) plugin. The first custom button will be the FAB command. Have every command of Obsidian right at your fingertips! (And you can even pick a pretty icon)

### Dark Mode

Reduce eye strain and save battery while you're up all night connecting. The tonal colour pallette automatically adapts to dark mode. For easy switching between modes on mobile, have a look at [Luna: Dark Mode Switcher](https://github.com/selfire1/obsidian-luna-dark-mode).
