# Material Flat, for Obsidian üé®
![Material Flat Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threethan/obsidian-material-flat-theme/main/screenshot.png)

**Take Obsidian on the go, your way.**
A theme that looks and works great - On all your devices.

## Goals
* Reflecting Google's [Material Design Guidelines](https://m3.material.io/) to feel native on Android, and beautiful anywhere else. ‚ú® 
* Look, and work, equally great on desktop and mobile.
* Support a wide variety of layouts, settings, and plugins without the need for additional configuration.
* Reduce visual clutter, not functionality. 
## Features
### Customizable Color Palette
Just about every color in Material Flat is derived from your accent color, and will adapt to both light and dark themes with ease!

No need for preset colors or complex menus, simply set your color in `Obsidian > Settings > Appearance` and enjoy.

*Note: You might have readability issues if your color is very close to pure white or black*

### Floating Action Button
